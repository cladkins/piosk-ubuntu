# PiOSK for Ubuntu

**One-shot set up Ubuntu in kiosk mode as a webpage shuffler, with a web interface for management.**

PiOSK transforms your Ubuntu machine into a kiosk mode display that cycles through web pages automatically. It includes a web-based dashboard for easy management of the displayed URLs.

## About This Project

This is an **Ubuntu adaptation** of the original [PiOSK project](https://github.com/debloper/piosk) by [Soumya Deb](https://github.com/debloper). The original PiOSK was designed for Raspberry Pi, and this fork has been modified to work seamlessly on Ubuntu systems.

**Original Project**: [PiOSK by Soumya Deb](https://github.com/debloper/piosk)  
**Original Author**: [Soumya Deb](https://github.com/debloper)  
**License**: MPL-2.0

## Features

- **Automatic Setup**: Single script installation for Ubuntu
- **Web Dashboard**: Manage URLs through a web interface
- **Auto-login**: Configures automatic login for your display manager
- **Tab Rotation**: Automatically cycles through configured web pages
- **Systemd Integration**: Runs as system services for reliability
- **Multiple Display Manager Support**: Works with GDM3, LightDM, and SDDM
- **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: Secure web interface on port 80
- **Snap Chromium Support**: Uses Ubuntu's snap Chromium for better compatibility
- **Power Management**: Disables screen lock, sleep, and hibernate for continuous operation
- **Desktop Environment Support**: Works with GNOME, KDE, and XFCE

## System Requirements

- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or newer
- Desktop environment (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.)
- Internet connection for initial setup
- At least 2GB RAM recommended
- Snap Chromium or system Chromium installed

## Quick Installation

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cladkins/piosk-ubuntu/main/scripts/setup.sh | sudo bash -
```

This single command will:
- Install all dependencies
- Configure autologin for your display manager
- Set up the kiosk system
- Install and configure nginx
- Create autostart entries
- Install systemd services

## Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cladkins/piosk-ubuntu.git
cd piosk-ubuntu
```

2. Run the setup script:
```bash
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh
```

## Configuration

### Basic Setup

1. After installation, visit `http://<your-ubuntu-ip>/` from any device on your network
2. You'll see the PiOSK dashboard with sample URLs
3. Add, remove, or modify the URLs as needed (at least 1 URL is required)
4. Click the `APPLY ‚èª` button to apply changes and reboot
5. After reboot, the kiosk mode will start automatically

### Advanced Configuration

The configuration file is located at `/opt/piosk/config.json`. You can edit it directly or use the web interface.

Example configuration:
```json
{
    "urls": [
        {
            "url": "https://example.com"
        },
        {
            "url": "https://another-site.com"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Display Manager Support

The setup script automatically detects and configures your display manager:

- **GDM3** (GNOME): Most common on Ubuntu
- **LightDM**: Used by XFCE and some other desktop environments
- **SDDM**: Used by KDE Plasma

## How It Works

1. **Autologin**: The system automatically logs in to the desktop on boot
2. **Autostart**: The kiosk application starts automatically when the desktop loads
3. **Web Dashboard**: Nginx serves the management interface on port 80
4. **Tab Rotation**: Chromium cycles through configured URLs in kiosk mode
5. **Configuration**: Changes made through the web interface are saved and applied on reboot
6. **Power Management**: Screen lock, sleep, and hibernate are disabled for continuous operation

## Power Management

PiOSK automatically configures your system for continuous kiosk operation by:

- **Disabling Screen Lock**: Prevents the screen from locking due to inactivity
- **Disabling Sleep/Hibernate**: Prevents the system from going to sleep
- **Disabling Power Button Actions**: Prevents accidental shutdowns
- **Configuring Desktop Settings**: Works with GNOME, KDE, and XFCE environments

These settings ensure your kiosk runs continuously without interruption. The settings are automatically restored when you uninstall PiOSK.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Display not working**: Ensure you're logged into a desktop session
2. **Web dashboard not accessible**: Check if nginx is running: `sudo systemctl status nginx`
3. **Chromium not starting**: Verify display permissions and X11 setup
4. **Auto-login not working**: Check your display manager configuration

### Service Management

Check service status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status piosk-dashboard
sudo systemctl status piosk-runner
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

Restart services:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart piosk-dashboard
sudo systemctl restart piosk-runner
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

View logs:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u piosk-dashboard -f
sudo journalctl -u piosk-runner -f
```

### Manual Display Manager Configuration

If auto-login doesn't work automatically, you can configure it manually:

#### GDM3
```bash
sudo nano /etc/gdm3/custom.conf
```
Add:
```ini
[daemon]
AutomaticLoginEnable=true
AutomaticLogin=yourusername
```

#### LightDM
```bash
sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
```
Add:
```ini
[SeatDefaults]
autologin-user=yourusername
autologin-user-timeout=0
```

#### SDDM
```bash
sudo nano /etc/sddm.conf.d/autologin.conf
```
Add:
```ini
[Autologin]
User=yourusername
Session=ubuntu.desktop
```

## Uninstallation

To remove PiOSK from your Ubuntu system:

```bash
sudo /opt/piosk/scripts/cleanup.sh
```

Or if you've installed manually:
```bash
sudo ./scripts/cleanup.sh
```

## Security Considerations

- The web dashboard runs on port 80 through nginx
- The kiosk mode runs with reduced privileges
- Consider disabling unnecessary network services for production use
- The system automatically logs in, so ensure physical security

## Differences from Original PiOSK

This Ubuntu version includes several improvements over the original Raspberry Pi version:

- **Ubuntu-specific setup**: Optimized for Ubuntu systems
- **Snap Chromium support**: Better compatibility with Ubuntu's package management
- **Nginx reverse proxy**: More robust web server setup
- **Autostart entries**: Better X11 authorization handling
- **Systemd services**: Improved service management
- **Multiple display manager support**: Works with GDM3, LightDM, and SDDM
